## Overview
### Description
Turtly is an app where users can write out their thoughts and emotions anonymously and share it with the world without any concern for judgement. A place where users can “let it out” and help relieve their trapped mind. It is a space like a turtle’s shell where inside, you are safe from the harshness of outside world, thus the name Turtly. Users can create posts with texts, photos, and audio notes which can be publicized (public posts will be limited to text posts). While it is open to public, their profile information will be kept anonymous. Users can mark their posts, view previously created posts, as well as get feeds of other people’s public posts.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Health & Fitness / Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile. It will have a mobile friendly layout with access to camera, audio, and location.
- **Story:** The app is unique in that it is not trying to be social. We want to be a place for relief from the avalanche of social-everything trend in apps, where you don’t have to be concerned about being politically correct, setting yourself up to social standards, or being judged; and just express your raw thoughts out loud.
- **Market:** We are targeting a niche market where we are trying to build a place where people can “un-social” for a moment in their lives. We believe that this niche market will serve a good amount of people who need a break from stressful moments from socialization.
- **Habit:** This app will be as simple as it can be and hassle free to encourage users to access it as often as possible. Our app should be a de-stressor, not add to it. An average user will mainly be creating by posting what is on their mind.
- **Scope:** We want a simple app with minimal features and deviate from anything that makes an app “social.” However, we want to add features such as pin-locks; audio; password change, etc. where we might encounter some challenges along the way. Our idea is clearly defined and we think it is an interesting idea to build.
